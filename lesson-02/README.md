## Installing application dependencies

Ensure you're inside the /lesson-02 directory and install pre-requisites node packages.

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Working in local development environment

Leverage Webpack capability to build web application and run locally while making web application changes.

Build, and startup webpack server as development (<http://localhost:1500>).

```bash
$ npm run serve-dev
```

Build and compile for production. This will generate files into `./build/public` that can then be deployed into production.

```bash
$ npm run serve-pro
```
